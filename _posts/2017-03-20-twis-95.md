we landed 110 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online, including the overall plans for 2017 and Q1. Please check it out and provide feedback!

This week's status updates are [here](https://www.standu.ps/project/servo/).

Congratulations to our new reviewers, [avadacatavra and canaltinova](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/616). Diane joined the Servo team last year and has been upgrading our networking and security stack, while NazÄ±m has been an important part of the Stylo effort so far. We're excited to see them both use their new powers for good!
