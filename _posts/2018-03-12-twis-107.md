In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2018-03-05..2018-03-12+user%3Aservo+),
we merged 85 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

Congratulations to [waywardmonkeys](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/809) for their new mandate to review and maintain the
low-level [harfbuzz](https://github.com/servo/rust-harfbuzz/) bindings, and their work to create safe higher-level bindings!
