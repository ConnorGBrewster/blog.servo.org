In the [past week](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2018-09-17..2018-09-24+user%3Aservo+),
we merged 95 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

Big shout-out to *@eijebong* for [digging into](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/21741) the underlying cause of an ongoing,
frustrating intermittent problem with running websocket tests in CI.
