In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2018-03-12..2018-03-19+user%3Aservo+),
we merged 89 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

We have been working on adding [automated performance tests](https://servo.org/dashboards/#webperf) for the
[Alexa top pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_websites), and thanks to contributions from the Servo
community we are now regularly tracking the performance of the top 10 websites.

### Planning and Status

Our [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online, including the overall plans for 2018.
