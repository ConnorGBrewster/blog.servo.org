In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2017-04-10..2017-04-17+user%3Aservo+),
we landed 127 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

We started [publishing](https://blog.servo.org/2017/04/13/windows/) Windows nightly builds on [download.servo.org](http://download.servo.org/). Please test them out and file issues about things that don't work right!

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online, including the overall plans for 2017.
Q2 plans will appear soon; please check it out and provide feedback!
