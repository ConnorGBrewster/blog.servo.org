In the [past three weeks](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2018-09-24..2018-10-15+user%3Aservo+),
we merged 181 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

Our Windows nightlies have been broken for several months for a number of reasons, and we have now fixed all of the
known breakage. If you're a Windows user, give our [latest builds](https://downloads.servo.org) a try! You can visit
arbitrary URLs by pressing Ctr+L.

The [Android Components](https://mozilla-mobile.github.io/android-components/) project [added a component](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/pull/1003)
to use Servo in any Android app.

We have a branch that allows Servo to build and run on [Magic Leap devices](https://www.magicleap.com):

### Planning and Status

Our [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online, including the overall plans for 2018.

This week's status updates are [here](https://www.standu.ps/project/servo/).

### Exciting Work in Progress

- paulrouget is [integrating Servo](https://github.com/MozillaReality/FirefoxReality/pull/498) into Firefox Reality.
- pyfisch is [rewriting keyboard input](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/21881) to better reflect the web's input model.
- gterzian is [creating a hang reporter](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/21673) that will provide better insight when Servo is performing poorly.
- eijebong is [updating hyper](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/21644) from 0.10 to 0.12, enabling Servo to make use of async I/O in the future
