This week, we merged 42 pull requests

Work on Windows support has started, in part. We're tracking progress [here](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/1908#issuecomment-73711409), let us know in IRC if you want to help out!

### Notable additions
 - Ms2ger made some JS safety improvements:
   - Adding the [`Unrooted<T>`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4836) JS pointer to be used when we're holding a pointer to an untraced JS value
   - Avoiding [`Deref` for `Root` till we get something akin to `DerefMove`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4850)
   - Switching the parser to [`JS<Node>`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4818)
 - Manish [fixed the Gonk build](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4864)
 - Josh added support for [firing events from dedicated workers to their corresponding `Worker` object](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4854)
 - Shing [added support for using a hostfile via the `$HOST_FILE` environment variable](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4702)

### Screenshots

This is Servo running on the Flame (Firefox OS):

This is running directly on top of Gonk (which is why I can't take an actual screenshot).

If you have a Flame (or other Firefox OS device) and want to try this out, steps for the build can be found [here](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4864). Note that the B2G clone and build will take a sizeable amount of space on your machine (~17GB). We're considering distributing a small prebuilt package with all the headers and libraries, however there might be licensing issues.

If you want to try it out without a build, ask Manishearth in IRC for the binaries (needs a rooted phone. Flames on v188 nightly are rooted by default).

### Meeting

[Minutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-02-09)

 - Servo's hiring! [Details](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/iiCg0nahOa) talk to Jack or Lars if you want to know more
 - Rust upgrade: It appears to be that we're stuck in the state of perpetual rustup.
 - We're going to make all of our dependencies track rustc nightly, to make it easier for others to use (and to make Rust upgrades easier)
 - Cookies landed!
 - Windows support: A couple of people are interested in working on this, we discussed some issues. More [here](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/1908#issuecomment-73711409).
 - Async DOM APIs: We'd like to propose some new DOM APIs that call into layout in an asynchronous manner, however we probably don't have the expertise/people power to do this now.
