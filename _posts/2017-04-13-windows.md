We began releasing nightly builds of Servo [last July](http://blog.servo.org/2016/06/30/servo-nightlies/), and we are pleased
to announce that our Windows builds are now ready for public consumption as well! They can be found on the
[official download page](https://download.servo.org/) alongside links to Linux and macOS builds, and will be updated on a
daily basis.

We'd like to recognize the recent efforts of [jonathandturner](https://github.com/jonathandturner) and
[codec-abc](https://github.com/codec-abc), who investigated and solved the final issues that were
[blocking](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/12125) this preview. This was also made possible through previous work by
[vvuk](https://github.com/vvuk/), [UK992](https://github.com/uk992), and [larsbergstrom](https://github.com/uk992). Thank you
all!

We encourage everyone on Windows to experiment with the nightly builds. This is pre-alpha software, so please
[file issues](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/new) about anything that doesn't work as expected!
